    <h2>This recipe is an Ukrainian one of my Great-Grandmothers passed down from the 
        years. They are great with melted butter and sauteed onions, or fry if 
        desired. They can also be frozen between layers of plastic wrap.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
        <li>5 pounds potatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound processed cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>onion salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until 
            tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, eggs and salt. Mix in a little water at a time until dough 
            is somewhat stiff. Roll dough in small sections about 1/4 inch thick. Using 
            a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make circle cuts.</li>
        <li>To make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and onion salt. 
            Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture, fold over and seal 
            edges. To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil, carefully dropping in 
            one at a time; stir once. They are done when they float to the top.</li>
    </ol>
