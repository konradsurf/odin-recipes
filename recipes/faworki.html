    <h2>Traditional Polish crispy pastry twists made for Carnival time. They are deep
        -fried and sprinkled with confectioners' sugar. Light and delicious!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2&#189 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rum</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>&#189 cup confectioner's sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, egg yolks, sour cream, sugar, butter, rum, and salt in a 
            large bowl; mix to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough lightly and roll out on a floured surface. Cut into strips 4 
            inches long and 3/4 inches wide. Cut a slit in the middle of each strip. 
            Twist and pull one end through the slit.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Test the temperature by dropping 
            in a pastry twist; the oil is ready when it browns and float to the surface.</li>
        <li>Fry pastry twists in batches until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. 
            Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar.</li>
